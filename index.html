            In its pursuit of German dominance in Europe and the acquisition of additional colonies, the heavily armed German Empire joined its ally Austria-Hungary in the war in August 1914. Drawing upon its swift victory in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, the German High Command expected another quick triumph. Instead, the war became a two-front conflict: against Russia in the east and against France and Britain in the west. From November 1914, the Western Front devolved into a brutal war of attrition in static trench warfare. Battles such as Verdun and the Somme claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers.
The widespread enthusiasm for war that gripped Europe in the summer of 1914 was also evident in Wolfenbüttel. When the 46th Lower Saxony Field Artillery Regiment left its quarters on August 8, 1914, to be transported to the front, the townspeople cheered on the departing soldiers. However, the euphoria dissipated as the first Wolfenbüttel soldiers “for Kaiser, people, and fatherland” fell in battle, the number of wounded returning to Wolfenbüttel steadily grew, and the brutalities of industrialized warfare became known. Local industries and workshops, such as the Gebrüder Welger Machine Factory, the Knust Furniture Factory, and the Busch, Barnewitz & Co. Canning Factory, shifted their production to support the war effort. The civilian population suffered from hunger due to Allied naval blockades and the resulting shortage of agricultural goods. Charitable donations from industrialists and institutions, including the Jewish community and the Samson School board, alleviated only the most extreme hardship. Starting in the summer of 1918, the newly emergent Spanish flu claimed lives among the already weakened civilian population.
Approximately 900 soldiers from the town and district of Wolfenbüttel lost their lives in the First World War. For years, disabled veterans and traumatized former soldiers—commonly known as “war tremblers”—shaped the cityscape. The high death toll, the suffering endured, and the growing social inequalities skillfully highlighted by leftist opponents of the war led to mounting war fatigue. Demands for the democratization of state and society undermined the authority of the monarchy, both in the German Empire and its federal states. The revolutionary movement that emerged brought an end to the rule of the Welf dynasty in the Duchy of Brunswick. Duke Ernst August was forced to abdicate on November 8, 1918. The revolution in Brunswick marked a turning point, creating opportunities for social change and democracy, including political equality for women, within the newly formed commune.
